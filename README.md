# Kestrel

_2025 Public Version_

This repository contains the code for Team 1678's Kestrel API. For an in-depth explanation of our scouting system, please see our [2025 Whitepaper](https://www.citruscircuits.org/uploads/6/9/3/4/6934550/whitepaper_2025_-_final.pdf).

## Overview 

Kestrel is a part of FRC team 1678's scouting system. It connects various frontend devices to our backend database. It is a REST API, and built in python utilizing the FastAPI library. Kestrel is designed to be as simple, understandable, and flexible as possible. It includes simple authentication and is designed to connect to a MongoDB database.

## Running Locally

If you're looking to run Kestrel locally, this guide will walk you through the steps.

### Virtual Environment  
You'll first need to set up a virtual environment. The way I would recommend is the built in venv module in python. You can set up this method by running these commands in the terminal

* Create a new virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`

* Activate the environment: `source venv/bin/activate`

* Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`


### Environment variables
In order to keep important data a secret, it is stored in environment variables. Copy the `env.example` file and rename it to `.env`.

 Inside you will find all the required environment variables, but without any values, so you will need to fill them in. 

* `MONGO_CONNECTION` This is the connection string for our cloud database, if you don't know where to find this, it's probably best to ask someone who does. It should include the full string, starting with the `mongodb+srv://`

* `API_KEY` This is the string that you need in order to access the API, because you are running locally you can put whatever you want.

* `TBA_KEY` A key to access The Blue Alliance's API

### Starting the API server

To start the API server, there are a few ways. The way I would personally recommend is to run `fastapi dev` in the terminal.   
It should start an api session and tell you where there server has been started, which should look something like `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.   
If you enter that into a browser, you won't see much. Instead go to the documentation page, found at your hosted link with `/docs` at the end, for example: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.  
Once you are at the docs, you will be able to test your various endpoints, but first you must authorize yourself. You can do this by just clicking the green button in the top right corner that says Authorize. Enter the api key you set in your environment variable and you should be good to go.

## Developing 

If you want to use this API, it's fairly simple. Assuming you use a MongoDB database, you mainly just have to change the different endpoints so that they process and return the data you would like.

### Why the name kestrel?
The previous 1678 API was named grosbeak, so I chose the name kestrel to continue the bird name scheme :)
